    ***Speed = returning time of new array***

    .unshift is 3.5 times faster than push method for tiny arrray		
    .unshift is 2.5 times faster than push method for small array		
    both methods .push and .unshift are about the same returning time but with push method slightly faster for medium array		
    .push is 15 times more faster than .unshift method for large array		 
    .push is 370 times more faster than .unshift method for large array 	
	
    							Recommand of method to use based on array size	

1)	with tiny and small arrays, the unshift methods take less running time(compared to .push method)								.unshift > .push	
2)	with medium array, the running time is about the same for both methods (.push method is still the winner)								 .push => .unshift	
3)	with large and the extrage arrays, the runnning time for push methods is way faster than unshifted methods than push method								.push > unshift	
										
	Between Unshift () and Push () methods: 									
										
	The push () method returns the last element adding a new element from the last index.									
	The little difference is that unshift () method adds the element at 0 index and all the values get shifted by 1 by ultimately returning the length of the array. 									
	Thus, as the array size increases, the returning time of the length of array is getting slower for unshift method as it has to go through all the elements from index 0 to the end of the array before									
	it returns with the array.									
	As the push method is simply add the new element then return with the new array without going from index 0
